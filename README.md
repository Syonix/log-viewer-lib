[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Syonix/log-viewer-lib.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Syonix/log-viewer-lib)

**Watch out: This library is still very WIP**
This is the core of the [Syonix Monolog Viewer](https://github.com/Syonix/monolog-viewer).

Use it, if you want to include the Log Viewer functionality in your app. 

If you want a pretty front end along with it, check out [Syonix Monolog Viewer](https://github.com/Syonix/monolog-viewer).
